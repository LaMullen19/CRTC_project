this is the explanation

//Welcome to the recreation room, here you will play a game of darts where you will have to guess a number and the closer to the 
actual number you get, the more points that come with it. After beating a bot score in darts, you will go to the weapon wheel where it will
randomly select a weapon for you to use at the gun range. Each gun has a different amount of shots and the more shots it has the lower 
the chance of you actually hitting the shot. You will have to successfully hit three out of the five targets at the range in order to 
unlock the green glass door where you will have to answer a riddle in order to open the door and get into the next room.//
